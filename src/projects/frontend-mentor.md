#### Overview

A few months when I was lacking inspiration to make projects I found [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Since then I started working on the challenges that appeared there, and, after a while it occurred to me that I didn't had a place to showcase the completed challenges outside of [GitHub](https://github.com/). So, I made this simple website with HTML and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Every now and then I'll fill it with whatever challenge I complete.
