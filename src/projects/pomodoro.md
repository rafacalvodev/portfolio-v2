#### Overview

I'm still learning React. So, instead of coding along a tutorial, I decided to do this small app. Every now and then I use it, and so far it's been useful.
\
\
For the styling I used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and for displaying the timer in a correct format I used [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/). For the rest of the app I used the [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) and [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) hooks to handle and fetch the timer and sessions, the [createContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) method was also used since I relied on the Context API to send states to other React components.
\
\
The functionality was first, since I was making sure the app worked (which took me quite a while to do). Then, when I was sure everything worked, I applied the styling with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
